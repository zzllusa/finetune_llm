# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Unsloth

This repository provides a step-by-step guide and code for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using **Unsloth**, a library designed to make fine-tuning faster and more memory-efficient. The process is optimized for a single GPU, making it accessible for smaller setups.

## Overview

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) allows you to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks or datasets. This repository focuses on:
- Loading and preprocessing datasets.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models using **Unsloth** for faster and more memory-efficient training.
- Applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
- Evaluating and saving fine-tuned models for future use.

The process is optimized for a single GPU, making it ideal for smaller setups or personal projects.

# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Unsloth

This repository provides a step-by-step guide and code for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using **Unsloth**, a library designed to make fine-tuning faster and more memory-efficient. The process is optimized for a single GPU, making it accessible for smaller setups.

## Overview

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) allows you to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks or datasets. This repository focuses on:
- Loading and preprocessing datasets.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models using **Unsloth** for faster and more memory-efficient training.
- Applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
- Evaluating and saving fine-tuned models for future use.

The process is optimized for a single GPU, making it ideal for smaller setups or personal projects.

## Features

- **Unsloth Integration**: Optimized for faster and more memory-efficient fine-tuning.
- **Single-GPU Support**: Designed to work efficiently on a single GPU.
- **LoRA Support**: Apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce computational costs.
- **Dataset Support**: Easily load and preprocess datasets using the `datasets` library.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance on test datasets.
- **Saving Models**: Save fine-tuned models and tokenizers for deployment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zzllusa/finetune_llm.git
   cd finetune_llm

    Install the required Python libraries:
    bash
    Copy

    pip install "unsloth[colab] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
    pip install transformers datasets

Usage

    Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    bash
    Copy

    jupyter notebook finetune_llm.ipynb

    Follow the instructions in the notebook to:

        Load and preprocess a dataset (e.g., IMDb for sentiment analysis).

        Fine-tune a pre-trained model using Unsloth and LoRA.

        Evaluate the model's performance on a test set.

        Save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer for future use.

Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

    unsloth: For faster and memory-efficient fine-tuning.
